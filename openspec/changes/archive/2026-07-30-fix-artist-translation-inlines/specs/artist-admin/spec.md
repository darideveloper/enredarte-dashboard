## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Inline translation management for Artist
The system SHALL display `ArtistTranslation` as a `StackedInline` inside the `Artist` edit form in Django Admin to allow editing Spanish (`es`) and English (`en`) bio text on the same page, pre-populating Spanish (`es`) on the first form and English (`en`) on the second form during creation, and suppressing extra blank forms when all translations already exist.

#### Scenario: Editing artist translations
- **WHEN** an administrator accesses an Artist change page in the admin
- **THEN** an inline section titled "Traducciones" SHALL render existing translations without appending extra blank forms when Spanish and English translations are present.

#### Scenario: Creating a new artist with pre-populated translation languages
- **WHEN** an administrator accesses the new Artist creation page in the admin
- **THEN** the two translation inline forms SHALL render with default language selections set to Spanish (`es`) and English (`en`).
